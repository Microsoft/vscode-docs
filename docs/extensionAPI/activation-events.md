# Activation Events - package.json

Extensions are activated lazily in VS Code.  As a result, you need to provide VS Code with context as to when your extension should be activated.  We support the following activation events:

* [`onLanguage:${language}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsonlanguage)
* [`onCommand:${command}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsoncommand)
* [`onDebug`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsondebug)
* [`workspaceContains:${toplevelfilename}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsworkspacecontains)
* [`onView:${viewId}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsonview)
* [`*`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationevents)

We also provide an overview of the [`package.json` extension manifest](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md) and the minimum required fields.

## activationEvents.onLanguage

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a file that resolves to a certain language gets opened.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onLanguage:python"
]
...
```

The `onLanguage` event takes a [language identifier](/docs/languages/identifiers.md) value.

Multiple languages can be declared with separate `onLanguage` entries in the `activationEvents` array.

```json
"activationEvents": [
    "onLanguage:json",
    "onLanguage:markdown",
    "onLanguage:typescript"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.onCommand

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a command is being invoked:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onCommand:extension.sayHello"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.onDebug

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated before a debug session is started:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onDebug"
]
...
```

### onDebugInitialConfigurations and onDebugResolve

There are two more fine-grained `onDebug` activation events:

* `onDebugInitialConfigurations` is fired just before the `provideDebugConfigurations` method of the `DebugConfigurationProvider` is called.
* `onDebugResolve:type` is fired just before the `resolveDebugConfiguration` method of the `DebugConfigurationProvider` for the specified type is called.

**Rule of thumb:** If activation of a debug extensions is lightweight, use `onDebug`. If it is heavyweight, use `onDebugInitialConfigurations` and/or `onDebugResolve` depending on whether the `DebugConfigurationProvider` implements the corresponding methods `provideDebugConfigurations` and/or `resolveDebugConfiguration`. See [Debug Type specific Hooks](/docs/extensionAPI/api-debugging.md#debug-type-specific-hooks) for more details on these methods.

## activationEvents.workspaceContains

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a folder is opened and the folder contains at least one file that matches a glob pattern.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "workspaceContains:**/.editorconfig"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.onView

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a view of the specified id is expanded:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onView:nodeDependencies"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.*

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever VS Code starts up. To ensure a great end user experience, please use this activation event in your extension only when no other activation events combination works in your use-case.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "*"
]
...
```

> **Note:** An extension can listen to multiple activation events, and that is preferable to listening to `"*"`.

> **Note:** An extension **must** export an `activate()` function from its main module and it will be invoked **only once** by VS Code when any of the specified activation events is emitted. Also, an extension **should** export a `deactivate()` function from its main module to perform cleanup tasks on VS Code shutdown. Extension **must** return a Promise from `deactivate()` if the cleanup process is asynchronous. An extension may return `undefined` from `deactivate()` if the cleanup runs synchronously.

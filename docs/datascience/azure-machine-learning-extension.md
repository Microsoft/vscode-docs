# Azure Machine Learning in VS Code

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based environment you can use to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track machine learning models. For more information on Azure Machine Learning, see [What is Azure Machine Learning?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml).

The Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension lets you use the features you're used to in Visual Studio Code for developing your machine learning applications.

## Azure Machine Learning 2.0 CLI support (preview)

The Azure Machine Learning 2.0 CLI enables you to train and deploy models from the command line, with features that accelerate scaling data science up and out while tracking the model lifecycle.

The Azure Machine Learning

- Spec file authoring
- Autocompletion
- Language support

## Train machine learning models

In Azure Machine Learning, you can use popular frameworks for training machine learning models such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and many more. The Azure Machine Learning extension makes it easy to submit and track the lifecycle of those models.

## Manage resources

You can create and manage Azure Machine Learning resources using. For more information, see [how to manage resources in VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-resources-vscode)

## Connect to remote compute instances

Compute instances are is a managed cloud-based workstation for developing machine learning applications. 

The Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension makes it easy to connect to and access resources in compute instances in real-time. For more information, see [connect to an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote?tabs=extension).

## Remote Jupyter server

Visual Studio Code offers great support for development using Jupyter notebooks. For more information. 

The Azure Machine Learning leverages the strong Jupyter notebooks support in Visual Studio Code and makes connecting to a remote compute instance and using them as repote Jupyter servers seamless. For more information, see [Configure a compute instance as a remote notebook server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote?tabs=extension)

## Git integration

By using the Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension to connect to a remote compute instance, you're able to leverage Visual Studio Code's Git suite of features.

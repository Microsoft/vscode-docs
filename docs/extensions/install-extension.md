# Installing Extensions

## Your Extensions Folder

VS Code looks for extensions under your extensions folder `.vscode/extensions`. Depending on your platform it is located:

* **Windows** `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
* **Mac** `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`
* **Linux** `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`

If you want to load your extension or customization each time VS Code runs, copy your project to a new folder under `.vscode/extensions`.

```
	$HOME/.vscode/extensions/myextension
```

## Sharing Privately with Others (Side-loading)
If you want to share your extension or customization with others privately, you can simply send them a copy of the output from the generator and ask them to add it under their `.vscode/extensions` folder. Alternatively, package your extension using the [vsce publishing tool](/docs/tools/vscecli.md) and send them the `.vsix` file. 

## Install a Packaged Extension (.vsix)

You can manually install an VS Code extension packaged in a `.vsix` file.  Simply install using the VS Code command line providing the path to the `.vsix` file.
```
code myExtensionFolder\myExtension.vsix
```
The extension will be installed under your user `.vscode/extensions` folder. You may provide multiple `.vsix` files on the command line to install multiple extensions at once.

You can also install a `.vsix` by opening the file from within VS Code.  Run `File | Open File...` or `kb(workbench.action.files.openFile)` and select the extension `.vsix`.  

## Publishing to the Gallery

If you want to share your extension with others in the [Gallery](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md), you can use the [vsce publishing tool](/docs/tools/vscecli.md) to package it up and submit it.

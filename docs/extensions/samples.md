# VS Code Extension Examples

## Extension basics

We have two walkthroughs that cover many of the core concepts - start with these:

* **[Your First Extension](/docs/extensions/example-hello-world.md)** - Explains the core extensibility concepts with a walkthrough.
* **[Word Count Extension](/docs/extensions/example-word-count.md)** - Another walkthrough building on the last.

## Sample extensions

Sample|Description|Type|In Marketplace
------|-----------|----|---------
**[Word Count](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-wordcount)**|Adds a word count to the status bar for Markdown files that updates on editing events.  We have a [walkthrough on how this was created](/docs/extensions/example-word-count.md).|[Extension](/docs/extensions/example-hello-world.md)|Y
**[MDTools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-MDTools)**|Work with selections and update based on common text processing e.g. ToUpper, HTMLEncode, ...|[Extension](/docs/extensions/example-hello-world.md)|Y
**[Decorator](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/decorator-sample)**|Shows how to decorate editor text with a border, colors, and a custom cursor as well as add an overview ruler highlight.|[Extension](/docs/extensions/example-hello-world.md)|N
**[Document Content Provider](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/contentprovider-sample)**|Shows how to use API commands and how to create _virtual_ documents using the `TextDocumentContentProvider`-API.|[Extension](/docs/extensions/example-hello-world.md)|Y
**[TSLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-tslint)**|Lint your TypeScript files based on TSLint|[Language Server](/docs/extensions/example-language-server.md)|Y
**[Mock Debugger](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug)**|Helps you build and test a debugger.|[Debuggers](/docs/extensions/example-debuggers.md)|Y
**[Go Language Support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go)**|Rich language support for [Go Lang](https://golang.org/) - IntelliSense, Debug, Peek, Rename, Syntax, ...|[Extension](/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api.md#languages)|Y
**[Tree Data Provider](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/tree-view-sample)**|Shows how to use `TreeDataProvider` API and contribute a custom view to VS Code|[Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#TreeDataProvider)|N

## Samples repository

There are many more VS Code extension examples in the [VS Code Extension Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) repository. You'll find examples showing best practices and working extensions using the latest APIs.

## Documentation

To orient yourself to the VS Code extensibility model, see the following topics:

* [Principles and Patterns](/docs/extensionAPI/patterns-and-principles) - Covers the core concepts and guiding patterns.
* [Language extension guidelines](/docs/extensionAPI/language-support) - Learn about declarative and programmatic language integration.

## Tools for building extensions

Tool|Purpose
----|-------
**[Extension Generator](/docs/extensions/yocode.md)**|To help you getting started implementing an extension, we have a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator.  This creates all the initial settings you need for the development environment to work well and includes the API Typing files and any relevant modules.  You can find the generator source code [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code).
**[Developing Extensions](/docs/extensions/developing-extensions.md)**|We have worked hard to provide an easy way to develop, debug and locally test your extensions.
**[Publishing Tool](/docs/extensions/publish-extension.md)**|Once you have a working extension, it's time to share it in the [extension Marketplace](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md). We have a simple command line tool for this. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsce).

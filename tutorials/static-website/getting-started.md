# Deploy a static website to Azure

This tutorial walks you through deploying a static website, such as an Angular or React [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) or simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript site, to Azure using [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage).

> **Note**: If you have your own server code, such as a Node.js/Express server, see the [App Service tutorial](/tutorials/app-service-extension/getting-started.md) instead.

## Overview

When you are building a static website, your production website is a collection of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other static files (images, fonts, etc.). You can host and serve these files using either App Service or Azure Storage, but we will use Azure Storage because it's a little simpler and a lot cheaper.

In this tutorial, we will deploy your static site to Azure Storage by doing the following:

1. Get the required accounts and dependencies.
2. Create or prepare an application for deployment.
3. Choose your preferred deployment method.
4. Deploy!

## Prerequisites

**Azure Account** - If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-static-website&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-static-website) for a free 30-day account with $200 in Azure credits to try out any combination of services.

**Node.js** - Download [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download), we recommend the LTS (long term support) version.

> **Note**: If you already have application code, you don't need to install Node.js as this tutorial only uses it to generate a sample project.

## Prerequisite check

Before we continue, ensure that you have all the prerequisites installed and configured.

- Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) to make sure you Azure Account is working.
- From a terminal, execute:

```bash
node -v
v8.7.0

npm -v
5.4.2
```

to ensure that both Node.js and npm are installed.

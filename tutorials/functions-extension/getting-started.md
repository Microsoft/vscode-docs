# Deploy to Azure using Azure Functions

This tutorial walks you through creating and deploying a JavaScript Azure Functions application using the [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extension. Create a new app, add functions and deploy in a matter of minutes from Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-functions-extension&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-functions-extension) for a free 30-day account with $200 in Azure credits to try out any combination of services.

You need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed along with [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download), the Node.js package manager.

To enable local debugging, you need to install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools#installing).

**On macOS**, install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
$ brew tap azure/functions
$ brew install azure-functions-core-tools
```

**On Windows**, install using [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```bash
$ npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@core
```

**On Linux**, follow the instructions in the Azure Functions Core Tools [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools#linux).

## Install the extension

The Azure Functions extension is used to create, manage, and deploy Functions Apps on Azure.

## Prerequisite check

Before we continue, ensure that you have all the prerequisites installed and configured.

In VS Code, you should see your Azure email address in the Status Bar and your subscription in the **AZURE FUNCTIONS** explorer.

Verify that you have the Azure Functions tools installed by opening a terminal and running `$ func`.

```bash
$ func
                  %%%%%%
                 %%%%%%
            @   %%%%%%    @

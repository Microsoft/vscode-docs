# April 2020 (version 1.45)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.45 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95168)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we received great feedback from our community, which helped us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22April+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

* We introduced **Focus Next Part** `kb(workbench.action.focusNextPart)` and **Focus Previous Part** `kb(workbench.action.focusPreviousPart)` commands to make it easy to navigate across the workbench.
* The Status Bar is now accessible and when focused, screen readers will read its content.
* Introduced appropriate ARIA labels in Open Editors, Breadcrumbs, and Problems view.

## Workbench

### Switch tabs using mouse wheel

When you use the mouse wheel to scroll over editor tabs, you currently cannot switch to the tab, only reveal tabs that are out of view. Now with a new setting `workbench.editor.scrollToSwitchTabs`, this behavior can be changed if you change it to `true`.

![Scroll Tabs](images/1_45/scroll-tabs.gif)

**Note:** You can also press and hold the `Shift` key while scrolling to get the opposite behavior (for example, you can switch to tabs even when the `scrollToSwitchTabs` setting is off).

### Custom window title separator

A new setting `window.titleSeparator` lets you change the separator character that is used in the window title. By default, a dash `'-'` is used.

![Window title separator using dash](images/1_45/window-title-separator.png)

### New theme colors for editor tabs

Some new colors were added to further theme workbench editor tabs:

* `tab.unfocusedInactiveBackground`: Inactive tab background color in an unfocused group
* `tab.hoverForeground`: Tab foreground color when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverForeground`: Tab foreground color in an unfocused group when hovering

### New theme color for editor title border

The existing color `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder` changed to render a border below tabs but above breadcrumbs. A new color `editorGroupHeader.border` let you render a border below the editor group header (for example, below breadcrumbs if enabled) to restore the previous behavior of `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder`.

### Updated sidebar section headers for default themes

We've updated the styling of the sidebar section headers for our default Dark and Light themes. We now use a transparent background and show a border for each header.

![Sidebar section headers](images/1_45/sidebar-section-header.png)

### Semantic token styling in the user settings

The setting to customize semantic theming rules in the user settings has been finalized. Semantic coloring is available for TypeScript and JavaScript, with support for Java and C++ under development. It is enabled by default for built-in themes and being adopted by theme extensions.

The `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations` allows users to overrule the theme settings and to customize the theming.

![Semantic Token Color Customization](images/1_45/customized-semantic-highlighting.png)

The setting above changes the **Default Dark+** theme. It gives a new style to parameters (italic and a new color) and underlines all symbols from a default library (e.g. `Promise`, `Map` and their properties).

Example that adds semantic styling to all themes.
```ts
"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
    "enabled": true, // enable semantic highlighting for all themes
    "rules": {
        // different color for all constants
        "property.readonly": "#35166d",

        // make all symbol declarations bold
        "*.declaration": { "bold": true }
    }
}
```

Theming for semantic tokens is explained in more details in the [Semantic Highlighting Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide#theming).


### New color for constants in the Default Dark+ theme

The Default Dark+ and the Default Light+ theme now color constants in a different shade than writable variables.

![Constant color in the Dark+ theme](images/1_45/new-constant-color-dark-theme.png)

![Constant color in the Light+ theme](images/1_45/new-constant-color-light-theme.png)

### More Workspace Recommendations

VS Code now recommends following git related extensions if your workspace is configured with git and github remote.

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)

## Integrated Terminal

### Removal of several prompt-related commands

The following commands have been removed:

* `workbench.action.terminal.deleteWordLeft`
* `workbench.action.terminal.deleteWordRight`
* `workbench.action.terminal.deleteToLineStart`
* `workbench.action.terminal.moveToLineStart`
* `workbench.action.terminal.moveToLineEnd`

These commands worked by sending a particular character sequence to the terminal, which was a best effort guess based on what command keybindings terminals use. The problem with these commands was that they were always a black box, you needed to literally search through the vscode codebase to figure out how they worked. They have been replaced with custom keybindings for the `workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence` command, which does the same thing in a generic way.

These are advanced keyboard shortcuts cannot be viewed in their entirety via the keybindings UI as they contain arguments, you can view them by running the **Preferences: Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)** command:

![Terminal send sequence keybindings JSON](images/1_45/terminal-send-sequence.png)

This should also help teach how to use the [very powerful sendSequence command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_send-text-from-a-keybinding).

### Support for pasting of multi-line text in PowerShell

Multi-line pasting never worked in PowerShell as VS Code always sent over the text in exactly the same way as typing it out. As explained above, several keybindings have been swapped to use the `workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence` command and you might have noticed a new keybinding was added for Windows only:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+v",                "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
                                     "when": "terminalFocus && !accessibilityModeEnabled && terminalShellType == 'pwsh'",
                                     "args": {"text":"\u0016"} },
```

This new keybinding will send the text representing `Ctrl+V` directly to PowerShell, which gets picked up by PSReadLine and handled properly.

*Theme: [Sapphire (Dim)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)*

### Control double-click word selection

The new `terminal.integrated.wordSeparators` setting enables customization of the double-click to select a word behavior.

## Debugging

### Automatic debug configurations

Setting up debugging in VS Code can be a daunting task because a user has to create a new debug configuration (or at least modify a template to her needs). In our continous effort to simplify the debugging experience, we have added a new feature that gives debug extension authors a means to analyse the current project and offer quality debug configurations automatically that do not require additional user configuration.

In a similar way to how build tasks are provided, the automatic debug configurations are grouped under the owning debugger (folder icon) in the debug view's configuration dropdown and the **Select and Start Debugging** quick pick. Once the debugger folder is chosen, VS Code presents all the automatic configurations available. Selecting one will start a new debugging session.

The following screen cast shows the feature for the new JavaScript debugger (in preview) and our educational Mock Debug:

![Automatic debug configurations](images/1_45/dynamic.gif)

The debug quick pick can be opened by typing 'debug ' (with a space) in **Quick open** (`kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)`) or by triggering the **Debug: Select and Start Debugging** command.

In the next milestone we'll add UI so that an automatic debug configuration can be easily added to the launch.json for further configuration.

### New Debug theme colors

There are new colors for styling the Debug view:

* `debugView.exceptionLabelForeground`: Foreground color for a label shown in the CALL STACK view when the debugger breaks on an exception
* `debugView.exceptionLabelBackground`: Background color for a label shown in the CALL STACK view when the debugger breaks on an exception
* `debugView.stateLabelForeground`: Foreground color for a label in the CALL STACK view showing the current session's or thread's state
* `debugView.stateLabelBackground`: Background color for a label in the CALL STACK view showing the current session's or thread's state
* `debugView.valueChangedHighlight`: Color used to highlight value changes in the debug views (for example, the Variables view)
* `debugTokenExpression.name`: Foreground color for the token names shown in debug views (for example, the Variables or Watch view)
* `debugTokenExpression.value`: Foreground color for the token values shown in Debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.string`: Foreground color for strings in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.boolean`: Foreground color for booleans in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.number`: Foreground color for numbers in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.error`: Foreground color for expression errors in debug views

## Tasks

### Disable faster quick pick

With version 1.44, we improved the picker that shows when you run the **Tasks: Run Task** command by changing the layout and making it faster. However, since this faster quick does make the task picker two levels deep depending on which task you want to run, you can now disable the faster picker with `task.quickOpen.showAll`.

### Save on run

Previously, all dirty editors were always saved when a task is run. Now, if you don't want to have your editors saved when you run a task, you can configure that behavior with `task.saveBeforeRun`.

## Languages

### TypeScript Status bar entry enhancements

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Prompt users to switch to the workspace version of typescript

The new `typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk` setting lets a workspace prompt users to switch to the workspace version of TypeScript:

![The prompt shown when opening a workspace with local TS version](images/1_45/ts-prompt.png)

To enable the prompt, include `"typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true` and `typescript.tsdk` as workspace settings.

### Markdown link to folders

Editor links in Markdown files and links in the Markdown preview can now point to folders. Clicking on one of these links will reveal the target folder in VS Code's File Explorer.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

We have been working the last couple of months to support synchronizing VS Code preferences across machines and this feature is available for preview on the [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release.

You can now sign in with your GitHub account to synchronize your VS Code preferences.

![Settings Sync Github](images/1_45/settings-sync-github.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

We also added support for sychronizing global snippets.

### Product icon themes

Visual Studio Code contains a set of built-in icons that are used in views and the editor, but can also be used in hovers, the status bar, and by extensions. These icons are **product icons** as opposed to **file icons**, which are used next to file names throughout the UI.

The product icons that ship with VS Code are contained in the [Codicon icon font](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons) and form the **default** product icon theme. Extensions can provide new product icon themes to redefine these icons and give VS Code a new appearance.

![Product Icon Themes](images/1_45/product-icon-themes.png)

See the [Product Icon Themes](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/product-icon-theme) documentation for more details and have a look at the [Product Icon Theme Sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/product-icon-theme-sample)

### New JavaScript debugger

This month we've continued making progress on our new JavaScript debugger. It's installed by default on Insiders, and can be installed [from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly) in VS Code Stable. You can start using it with your existing launch configurations by enabling the `debug.javascript.usePreview` setting. Here are some new features added this month:

**Profiling Support**

You can capture CPU profiles from your Node.js or browser applications by clicking the new "Profile" button in the Call Stack view, or using the **Debug: Take Performance Profile** command. Once you do, you can choose how long the profile will run: until you stop it, for a length of time, or until you hit another breakpoint.

After the profile ends, it's saved in your workspace folder and visualized in VS Code. When you open the profile, code lenses are added to your files containing performance information at a function level and for certain 'hot' lines. Unlike profiles captured in many other tools, the recorded profile is sourcemap-aware.

![Animation showing the process of taking a profile](images/1_45/js-debug-profiling.gif)

*Theme: Earthsong, Font: Fira Code*

**Auto-Attach Integration**

When `debug.javascript.usePreview` is turned on, VS Code's [auto-attach](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_auto-attach-feature) will use a new method provided by `js-debug` that allows all terminals to work similarly to the Debug Terminal. Compared to auto-attach using the existing debugger:

- The debugger is attached immediately allowing you to hit breakpoints early on in the program
- Child processes are debugged automatically
- There's no process-polling overhead during auto attach.

**Copy Complex Values from Variables View**

Previously, trying to copy complex values, like objects, from the vscode **Variables** view would often result in truncated or incomplete data. Changes in VS Code and js-debug allows us to copy the complete value.

![Animation showing copying and pasting a very large array](images/1_45/js-debug-copy.gif)

### Workspace symbol search in all open TypeScript/JavaScript projects

When using TypeScript 3.9+, VS Code's [workspace symbol search](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_open-symbol-by-name) now includes results from all opened JavaScript and TypeScript projects by default. We previously only searched the project of the currently active file.

This is controlled by the new `"typescript.workspaceSymbols.scope"` setting. To revert to the old behavior, set: `"typescript.workspaceSymbols.scope": "currentProject"`.

### Improved links in the terminal

Links in the terminal have undergone an overhaul, changing out the backing system for a much more robust implementation that enables:

* The use of the editor's link detection for better web and `file://` link detection.
* Folder link support, either opening the folder in the Explorer or opening a new VS Code window.
* Actioning different link types differently, falling back to "word" links that search the workspace (based on the `terminal.integrated.wordSeparators` setting).
* Similar link highlighting and hover experience to the editor.

![Terminal with various links](images/1_45/terminal-links.gif)

*Theme: [Topaz (Dim)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-topaz)*

A list of known issues is available [in this query](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegrated-terminal-links).

### Dynamic view icons and titles

This milestone, we continue to improve on the work to make the layout more flexible. Moving views around the workbench allows you to create new icons in the Activity Bar or new tabs in the Panel. To make it easier to understand what lives in one of these newly created view containers, we have updated the logic to be easier to understand.

Now, when you have a custom container, we will inherit the title and icon from the first visible view. This will allow you to change it by rearranging the views. For containers that are built-in or from extensions, we will try to preserve this icon as long as possible. Below you can see that when a new view is placed at the top of the view container, its icon and title are updated.

![Dynamic icons and titles](images/1_45/dynamic-views.gif)

Lastly, you can now move your custom containers around with all of the containing views in one movement. Below you can see dragging of a Terminal and Output view combination into the Activity Bar.

![Moving whole View Containers](images/1_45/move-composite.gif)

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_45.md).

### GitHub Issue Notebook

The VS Code team is working on native support for notebooks. The most prominent notebooks these days are Jupyter notebooks and while looking at them very closely we want to build a notebook soluation that is unbiased and supports different styles of notebooks.

One of those notebooks is [GitHub Issue Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github-issue-notebooks) which allow to manage issue and pull request searches and which render result inline:

![GitHub Issue Notebook](images/1_45/gh-issue-notebook.gif)

This extension is still under development and only works with VS Code Insiders but with it you can experience notebooks first hand and you can provide us with feedback.

## Extension authoring

### Deprecating and archiving of the vscode NPM module

In June 2019, we [split the vscode module](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_splitting-vscode-package-into-typesvscode-and-vscodetest)  into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test` in light of the `event-stream` incident. Today, a [security alert for minimist](https://snyk.io/blog/prototype-pollution-minimist/) has caused security alerts for extensions that still depend on `vscode`, which depends on `mocha@5.2.0` and therefore `minimist@0.0.8`. Unfortunately, `mocha@5.2.0` no longer receive updates and upgrading to a new `mocha` version would break existing functionalities.

We published a new version of `vscode` that removes some unnecessary dependencies. We also archived the [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-vscode) and deprecated the [vscode module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode) on npm. Please [migrate](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension#migrating-from-vscode) to `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`.

### New Completion Item Kinds

We have added two new entries to `vscode.CompletionItemKind` that represent issues and users. This for instance allows you to suggest usernames when adding TODO tags.

### Working with URIs

We have added `vscode.Uri.joinPath`. It is a factory function that creates new URIs by joining path segments with an existing URI. Think of this as Node.js' `path.join` utility but for URIs.

For extensions, we now expose the URI at which they are installed via `Extension.extensionUri` and via `ExtensionContext.extensionUri`. With the join utility, you can now create URI for resources of your extension.

For example:

```ts

const fileUri = vscode.Uri.joinPath(context.extensionUri, './file.png');
const bytes = await vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(fileUri);
```

### debug/callstack/context menu inline group

We now support contributions to the `debug/callstack/context` menu `inline` group. Commands contributed to this group will be rendered inline in the Call Stack when a user hovers over the Debug Session element.

![Call Stack inline](images/1_45/callstack-inline.png)

## Language Server Protocol

Work has started on the [3.16 version](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/) of the specification. As a first step the call hierarchy support got move out of the proposed state. But please note that the 3.16 spec is not final yet. So depending on feedback changes might still occur.


## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.


### Contribute to terminal environments

This new proposed API was introduced last month that enables extension authors to contribute to terminal environments. This month has mainly been applying some UI on top of the feature and polishing it up. There is now a warning icon when a terminal has a "stale" environment that shows a rich hover explaining what's going to change and includes a convenient **Relaunch terminal** action. There's also an information icon available when changes are active but this is disabled by default.

![Terminal stale environment warning](images/1_45/terminal-env-stale.png)

### Providing debug configurations dynamically

We have extended the debugging extension API to give debug extension authors a way to add debug configurations dynamically based on information found in the workspace or project.
These debug configurations will appear in the same locations where previously only the static debug configurations from the launch.json were shown.
In this release dynamic debug configurations are shown in the debug view's configuration dropdown and the **Select and Start Debugging** quick pick.
In a future release we are considering to show them in the "Welcome" view too.

The new API is based on the `provideDebugConfigurations` method of the existing `DebugConfigurationProvider`. Until this release the `provideDebugConfigurations` was called by VS Code to provide the initial "static" debug configurations to be copied into a newly created launch.json. With the new API a `DebugConfigurationProvider` can now be registered via `vscode.debug.registerDebugConfigurationProvider` for the "dynamic" case by passing the value `DebugConfigurationProviderTriggerKind.Dynamic` to the new optional `triggerKind` argument. With this VS Code will call the `provideDebugConfigurations` method whenever the list of all debug configurations is about to be presented in the UI.

In order to activate extensions that make use of this new API on time, a new activation event `onDebugDynamicConfigurations:<debug type>` has been introduced. The `<debug type>` is mandatory and denotes for which debugger the dynamic debug configurations are specified.

A [usage example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/6be4f5b4b246dafe25f1e1d8ef420f7dccd8f627/src/extension.ts#L31-L55) can be found in Mock Debug.

### Custom Editors

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## New documentation

### Docker Compose

There is a new [Docker Compose](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/docker-compose) topic explaining how the Microsoft [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) can help you add Docker Compose files to your projects to allow you work easily with multiple Docker containers.

### Java topics

The Java topics have been updated and include new topics on [Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-linting) and [Refactoring](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-refactoring) Java source code using the [Java extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).
